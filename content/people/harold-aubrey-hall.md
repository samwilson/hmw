Mr. Aubrey Hall's offices
are also the local abode of
the Adelaide Steamship Co.,
the South British Insurance Co., and
the new Balla Balla Copper Mines
Co. Ltd., for all of which Mr. Hall acts
as agent. He has resided in Cossack
for the last thirty years. He started
his present business in 1894. Besides
holding the previously-named agencies,
Mr. Hall is a general shipping,
Customs, and forwarding agent, and
is port representative for many of the
stations within a hundred miles
radius. All the wool, embracing the
clips from the east of the Yule River
and west of Fortescue, and for 200
miles inland, is shipped from Cossack.
The total for the past twelve months
was about 7,000 bales. That which
is not carted to Roebourne direct is
picked up at the coastal creeks and
transhipped at Cossack Roads to the
Singapore steamers. The number of
sheep and kangaroo skins forwarded
by this firm during last year was
approximately 50,000. Mr. Hall is
also one of the proprietors of a

A BUSH TRAGEDY.

Whilst travelling in from Quobba Station with a thousand sheep for shipment at Carnarvon,
Mr. Aubrey Hall, drover, and two natives, Balby and one known as Teddy Edwards,
were accidentally poisoned about 24 miles from Carnarvon.
Hall had arranged for water to be placed at certain places along the route which is a dry one.
About 9 o'clock on Sunday morning whilst travelling along in Colilie paddock on Boolathana
they came across a petrol tin alongside the road which appeared to contain water.
Though they apparently had water in their water bags they drank from the tin, and watered their dogs and horses.
Shortly afterwards they all became sick, the dogs died and also one of the horses,
while later on Edwards be came rapidly worse than the other men and died.
Messages were conveyed to Carnarvon police from Quobba Station whence the news had been carried by a truck driver,
and from Mr. Hall who had ridden in to Boolathana Station, following which Constable Summers,
accompanied by Mr. George Munro of Dalgety & Co., left for the scene about 7.30 p.m. and
brought the body of Edwards in to Carnarvon morgue.
A post mortem was held by Dr. Stewart, but the result is not yet known.
What the tin contained or why it was left alongside the road is at present unknown.

The electoral roll lists him as a "station-hand" in 1955, and before this as a "pastoral employee".<ref>''WA Legislative Assembly Electoral Rolls for Coorow, Carnamah and Three Springs 1904-2005'' database by Jill Tilly (2008), cited at https://www.carnamah.com.au/bio/harold-aubrey-hall</ref>

By the end of the 1950s he was living in a caravan at Comer Street in Como, Perth.<ref>[[Aubrey Hall with caravan, 4]]</ref>

He was an adept horseman, and rode well into his 80s.
He died aged 91 on 11 January 1963, in Swanbourne.{ref|FindAGrave}

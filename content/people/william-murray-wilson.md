Murray Wilson (4 June 1914 – 28 September 1953) was a pilot and timber merchant from Perth, Western Australia.

Murray was born in Claremont[^WABMD208] on 4 June 1914 to Jim and Edith Wilson.

His father had a house in Shenton Park on half an acre. It was still there, although unrecognisable, in 2005.

He married {link|people/helen-margaret-hall|Margaret} on 2 July 1941.[^MurrayMargMarriageNotice]

Murray served in the RAAF during the Second World War. Service number 406376.[^NAAA9300]
His father died in June 1942, just after Murray turned 28.

For his service during the war, Murray was awarded[^RMWDeptAirLetter] four campaign stars
(1939–45 Star, Atlantic Star, Africa Star & Clasp, and Pacific Star)
and three medals (Defence Medal, War Medal 1939–45, and Australia Service Medal 1939-45).

In 1948 C. M. Wilson lent [Margaret](./helen-margaret-hall.html) one thousand pounds.[^perscomm]

By the early `50s, Murray was a director in the timber firm C.M. Wilson Co Pty Ltd
which was founded by his uncle Charles William McHarg Wilson
and operated from premises on Troode Street in West Perth.[^CompanyChiefs]

On the evening of Monday, September 28 1953,[^WADeaths][^WestAusDeathNotices][^VictimEstate]
just prior to a shareholders' meeting at the company offices, Murray and another director (William Ewart Livingstone)
were shot dead by a former director[^InsanityVerdict] (and current shareholder) of the company, William Charles Fawcett.
The weapon was a sawn-off .303 rifle,[^GuiltyInsane][^CompanyChiefs][^TimberDirectors] with which Fawcett
shot each of his victims once through their chests; they were both dead within minutes.[^CompanyChiefs]
Murray worked at the office, and Fawcett had waited outside in his vehicle until he saw Livingstone arrive.[^MurderDirectors]
The three men were alone in the office.[^NewAngle]
Livingstone had brought his rifle with him that day with the intention of killing both men.[^DoubleMurder]

Fawcett was seen by Livingstone's daughter[^FawcettRemanded] leaving the office after the shooting and driving away.
He went home to his wife at their home at 66 Victoria Avenue, Claremont
(near Murray's home in Congdon Street, Swanbourne)[^FawcettRemanded],
told her what he had done, cleaned the gun, and (it is to be supposed) waited for the police to arrive.[^DoubleMurder]
He was arrested either one[^TheAge1935] or four[^SMHDoubleMurder] hours later.
The next day he was charged with murder,[^SMHDoubleMurder] but later a jury found against this.

He said that his motive was financial:
he believed that the directors were trying to cheat him out of his share in the company.[^DoubleMurder]
He had attempted legal action, but didn't have a case.[^DoubleMurder]

The trial was held on the evening of Monday, 14 December,
and the ``elderly'', ``diminutive'', ``white-haired''[^NewAngle] Fawcett was
found not guilty on the grounds of insanity.
He was also in the timber trade.[^FawcettRemanded]

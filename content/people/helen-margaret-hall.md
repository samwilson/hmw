In the absence of her father the bride was given away by her uncle, Mr. Jack Lodge, and wore a charming trained frock of
white lace, cut on gracefully simple lines. Her filmy tulle veil (which had been worn by her mother on her wedding day)
was held in place with a halo of silver lame and orange blossom, and she carried a beautiful bouquet of white plum blossom and clematis.

There were three bridesmaids, Misses Patricia and Judith Donegan, and Joan Hall Miss Patricia Donegan wore a graceful cape frock of pale coral pink
georgette and carried a posey of pink and mauve flowers. Misses Judith Donegan and Joan Hall wore frocks of mauve
georgette relieved with deep violet, and carried posies of violets.
Mr. Tom Draper was best man and Messrs. G. McCausland and F. Martin were groomsmen.

After the ceremony a small reception was held at 8 Outram-street, West Perth, the home of Mrs. Ernest Hall,
who wore a deep blue lace frock. Mrs. A. Hall (mother of the bride) chose a frock of navy blue floral georgette and carried
a bouquet of crimson sweet peas. Mrs. Ernest Donegan (mother of the bride groom) wore a saxe blue frock with a matching coat of blue velvet.
Special guests at the reception were Mr. and Mrs. T. S. Lodge (the grandparents of the bride) whose toasts were honoured
with those of the bride and bridegroom. Later in the evening the bride and bridegroom left by motor car for their honeymoon,
the bride travelling in a smart ensemble in two shades of blue.

title: Charles William McHarg Wilson
---

Charlie Wilson was born in Fitzroy on 26 September 1873
to [William Wilson](./william-wilson.html) and [Mary Wilson (née McHarg)](./mary-mcharg.html).[^birth]
The order of his middle names varies in some sources.

When he was twelve years old, his brother [Andrew](./andrew-oswald-wilson.html) (who was teaching in a school in Warrnambool)
asked him to buy some items in Melbourne and post them to him.
A money order was included, and Charlie made the purchases
— but made sure to keep 10% of the funds back, as a commission to himself!
The family was not impressed with this, especially as Andrew was at the time sending most of his wage home
(something that their other brothers had also done).

Charlie later became apprenticed to his uncle Robert, who had a high-class grocery store in Melbourne.
After about only a year Robert broke the apprenticeship,
causing Charlie to sue his uncle and to be awarded £1,000 in compensation.

With this sum, Charlie moved to Perth and started the timber merchant business *C.M. Wilson & Co. Pty Ltd*.

By about 1920 he was back in Melbourne, and built his house *Linlathen* at 133 Mont Albert Road in Canterbury, Victoria.

In 1948 Charles Wilson lent his niece-in-law Helen Margaret Wilson (née Hall) £1,000.

He lived at *Linlathen* until his death in 1957. He had developed Parkinson's disease.

He showed early promise of being a successful businessman.
He had kept a letter that his brother Andrew had written to him, Andrew then teaching in a school in Warrnambool.
Charlie had evidently been given the job of buying a few things for his brother, andrew had sent him a Money Order to pay for them,
the twelve-year-old Charlie did it and sent a Money Order back with 10% deducted for his commission.
He was tickisted businessmanistedised off in no uncertain terms, this was a time when Andrew was sending most of his earnings home
(his brothers had also done this) to help with family finances. Charlie learnt that family is family. Charlie later became apprenticed to his Uncle Robert Wilson who had a high-class Grocery store in Melbourne. After being there about a year Robert evidently thought he had reason to break the apprenticeship, Charlie was without a job, and Charlie sued his Uncle Robert and was awarded a thousand pounds in compensation. So Auntie Agnes told me, she said this was how he started his timber business in Perth. There is no doubt that Charlie was a hard-headed, tight-f

At the Perth Barracks, c.1900.

James Herbert Wilson (known as `Jim' to everyone save his mother; she called him Herbert)
was born on 6 February 1872 in Collingwood, Melbourne[^VicPioneers] to \bioref{Mary_McHarg} and [William Wilson](./william-wilson.html).

The family had land in Kinglake in Murrindindi Shire,[^VicNames]
and in his early 20s Jim went there to grow potatoes so that he could earn some money to support the family[^rae1] back in Melbourne.
While he was living up there in a small shack he built himself, his younger sister Jessie died of TB,
and his brother \bioref{Oswald_Andrew_Wilson} moved to Perth to practise Architecture.[^rae1].

At the peak of the gold rush, c.~1890--95, Jim followed him and they went to find gold in Kalgoorlie, but with no luck[^rae1].

He married \bioref{Edith_Olive_Hall} on 30 January 1904 in Perth,[^JimEdithMarriage][^JimEdithMarriageCert]
when they were living in a rented house in Lyall Street in South Perth.[^rae1]

"and then I think after Jean and Gordon were born, he had a stroke of luck and won 100 pounds, whether on a horse or a lottery or a raffle I have no idea, but the result was that he was the owner of two blocks of land west of Subiaco. Andrew designed and supervised the building of the house."[^rae1]

"In the middle of June of 1914 my father bought as farm at Quairading for which he paid 1000 pounds sterling.''[^rae2]
Avon Location 8286. Train to Perth.

c.1920: pressure from family to sell farm (for £2000) as Charlie had started \emph{C.~M.\ Wilson Pty.\ Ltd.} in Murray Street.[^rae2]

Had a house in Shenton Park on half an acre. It's still there, although unrecognisable.

Mid-thirties had a heart attack on the boat home from Devonport, got home and Charlie insisted he stop work.[^rae2]

Jim died on 1 June 1942 in Perth.[^rae2]

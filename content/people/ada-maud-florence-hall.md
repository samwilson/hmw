> Ada Maud Florence Solberg applied to Mr. Justice Booth in the Divorce Court this morning for the dissolution of her
> marriage with Anton Ludwig Solberg, a Norwegian sailor, on the ground of desertion.
>
> Mr. F. J. H. Shaw appeared for the petitioner. The respondent did not appear.
>
> Petitioner, in her evidence, said she was married to respondent at Fremantle in 1893. They lived in and about
> Fremantle for a couple of years, when her husband went to Fiji as a sailor, being away three years. He sent her no
> money, and she was compelled to earn her own living. While he was away he wrote her only one letter. On his return
> they went to Karridale, and lived there for 18 months, when a cousin of her husband's, who was captain of a sailing
> ship, then in Fremantle, offered him and his family a trip home to see his people. They went to Christiania, and a
> couple of months after arriving her husband took a timber contract. While they were in Norway the authorities asked
> her husband if he was going to reside in the country. He
said no, as being a naturalised British
subject he intended to return to Aus-
tralia. The authorities later required
her husband to undergo his military
service, but he refused, repeating he
was returning to Australia. Their
first child was born in Australia, but
a second was born in Norway.
While she was in Norway she did
not lead a very happy life, being a
stranger in a strange land. Her hus-
band also drank and gambled a lot,
frequently starting on a Saturday
afternoon and keeping it up until
Monday morning. After being in
Norway three years her husband said
the climate was too severe for him
after Australia, and desired to return.
He had no money, and she secured the
passage money for herself and eldest
child from her people in Fremantle.
Her husband had only sufficient money
to pay his passage as far as Bremer-
haven, saying he would ask the cap-
tain of the boat they were on, the
Stuttgart, to allow him to work his
passage out. The captain, however, did not do so, and he told her to come on to Fremantle with the two children, and he would work his passage out
by the next boat. She came out and had neither seen or heard from her husband since then, which was in June 1904.

> Mr. Shaw said service of the citation had been made by substitution, the requisite advertisements having been inserted
in the local press and a daily paper circulating in Christiania.
>
> A decree nisi, returnable in six months, with the custody of the youngest child, was granted the petitioner.

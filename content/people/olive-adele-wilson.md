{smallcaps|The} marriage was solemnised in the Ross Memorial Church, on Tuesday evening, April 21, between Miss Adele Wilson,
second daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Wilson, of Shenton Park, and Mr. James Lang, elder son of Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Lang,
of Salisbury-street, Subiaco. Dr. Munro Ford officiated. The bride, who was given away by her father,
wore a frock of parchment satin, the cowled bodice falling Into soft folds and the draped sleeves finished with small buttons
to the elbow. The simply cut skirt fell into a long train. Her veil delicately embroidered with acorns fell from a
coronet of orange blossom, and she carried a trailing bouquet of white and pink flowers.

There were two bridesmaids, Misses Rae Wilson (sister of the bride) and Jenny Lang (sister of tbe bridegroom).
Both wore frocks of pale green georgette, the pleated bodices embroidered in silver thread on neck and sleeves.
Their hats of stiffened green tulle were finished at the back with green velvet flowers,
and they carried trailing bouquets of pale pink rosebuds.
Mr. J. Abrahams was best man, and Mr. Murray Wilson groomsman.

After the ceremony, Mr. and Mrs. Wilson held a reception at the Karrakatta Club hall.
They were assisted by Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Lang in receiving the guests.

Roebourne \
June 30 1898

Dear Mr. Hall:

I have already assauged
the order of services for Sunday.
I will be here for Mattins & Holy
Eucharist in the morning. On
Sunday afternoon I will come to
Cossack on the train & will give
you Evensong & remain in {?}
at 7:30 P.M. Any baptisms & churchings
can take place at any time before
Evensong, or any time in the
{?} of Monday, as I shall have
to spend Sunday night with you.
If you have no {?} I can
revise the hymns. The hymns will
probably be numbers 449 the {?}
Paslms in Glory & 27

Yours very truly,

W. Sharp, Rev.

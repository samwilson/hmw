## Transcription

BURKETT & GOSTELOW.\
Chartered accountants (Aust.)\
C.A.P. GOSTELOW, FCA (Aust.)

Marine Chambers, Carnarvon.

Dear Mr Hall,

I received your message {?|yesterday} —
& by strange coincidence a letter came
from Alec this morning — asking me whether
I could let him know of anyone who
wanted to go down to Perth.

He intends coming up from {?|Garaloo}
on Sunday morning & would like to leave for
Perth (in my car) on Sunday eve.

I am sure he would like you to
accompany him.

Sincerely yours\
{?|}

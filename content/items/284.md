ber.ip P.0.,

H. A. Hall, Esq., \ CARNARVON

W. AUST.

Dear Sir, /

We thank you for your letter of i4th June regarding Beche-de-mer (Trepang) as a source of supply for the manufacture of Gelatine. This material is not used by us in any of our processes, and in the circunstances we regret that we are unable to take advantage of your offer.

We might add, for your information, that Similar proposals have been made to us from time to time, but in view of the foregoing remarks nothing could be done in the matter.

It is interesting to read that you have found our Neatsfoot Oil very satisfactory. This Oil finds a ready market in Australia as it is a straight out Oil and is not blended in any way. Should you have any difficulty at any time in securing supplies, please communicate with our West Australian representative -

Mr. Jack Dyson, Bedford Place, Perth ° Thanking you for having written to us. We remain,

Yours faithfully,

DAVIS GELATINE (AUSTRALIA) pty. LTD.

Mr Aubrey Hall
Cossack

Dear Sir—

Chq herewith 5/- with thanks
for attention to postman team.

Yours truly

{?|Ross Anderson}

P.S.

Everything out here {?|lovely}
good clips etc.

We passed off about 8000 sheep—
also number of cattle and horses:
Have 5000 lamb marked already
for this year. Best paddock yielded
23½ bales to the 1000, next best
16½; or 14 right through 6000 odd
being shorn with 9 months wool.
Shore 17000 & will shear 15000 next
year. Big sales for small place.
Great country, out east!

{?|R.A.}

Regards to the "family".

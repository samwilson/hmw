## Transcription

    "It was merry in the glowing morn
    Among the gleaming grass
    To wander as we wandered many a mile.
    And watch the cool tobacco smoke in white wreaths as it passed
    Sitting loosely in the saddle all the while.
    T'was merry in the blackwoods
    When we spied the station roofs
    To wheel the wild scrub cattle at the yard.
    With a running fire of stockwhips
    And a firey run of hoofs
    The hardest day was never then too hard."

"Gordon"

To E. & W. Hall,

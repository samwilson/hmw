## Transcription

"It was merry in the glowing morn{br}
Among the gleaming grass{br}
To wander as we wandered many a mile.{br}
And watch the cool tobacco smoke in white wreaths as it passed{br}
Sitting loosely in the saddle all the while.{br}
T'was merry in the blackwoods{br}
When we spied the station roofs{br}
To wheel the wild scrub cattle at the yard.{br}
With a running fire of stockwhips{br}
And a firey run of hoofs{br}
The hardest day was never then too hard."

"Gordon"

To E. & W. Hall,

Dear Mr Hall

I return your book "Here in
Australia" with thanks, also paper, which was
overlooked before I went South last month and
am sorry about that.

Came home again
2 weeks ago after a few weeks pottering
about the farm.

At present doing a few
necessary jobs here but very much
slowed down now. On Tuesday I had
a run up around York and Northam
with Mr {?|Buffy} on this pub inspections.

The crops that way look splendid
and {?|ragmaking} has commenced. Out
further East they need rain very badly for
finishing. In common with all the rest my
brother and his sons flopped with their first tobacco
crop; that industrin in Australia is now very much
on "the knees of the Gods" and needs Federal Government
Control. Old George's pretty good also his son — we
miss you for a yard I can assure you. We do
hope that you are your cheerful self. I am still
working on the historical research.

Sincerely\
A.E. Blackers

## Transcription

"Yaringa"\
28/4/35

Dear Mr Hall,

Just a short note in a
hurry. As you will note by the
address, am at 'Yaringa' as {?|Norman}
is off to Perth. Allan will be
back next week-end.

Did you, perchance, over-carry
that parcel of {?|A.C.R's}
which I gave you, he is going
{?|up} on the mail & wants those
things, so if you have them
could you formward them
per 'Mail'

Yours faithfully\
{?}

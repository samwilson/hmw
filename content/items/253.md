Derby Old Brigade

by Jim Wright

You strike them around the town or maybe at the pub,{br}
These "oldtimers," telling how they earnt their early grub.{br}
Old Dug, will tell of pack mules, he ran out to the Ord,{br}
Of rain and bog, runaway blacks, and creeks he had to ford.

Then Gordon will chip in, and he's quite easily heard,

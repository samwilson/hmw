  A collection of envelopes of letters sent to H. Aubrey Hall in the 1940s and '50s.
  The letters were removed (by Judith Hall) and some may be represented elsewhere on this site.
  Note that the dates recorded for each are generally the postmark dates,
  so may not be the actual dates on which the letters were written.

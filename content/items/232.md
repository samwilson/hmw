description: A box of Cossack-related letters, telegrams, receipts and other documents accumulated by [[WSH]] and other members of his family in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Digitisation process:
The papers were removed one at a time from the box, loose dirt brushed off, folds and creases flattened out,
and the unfolded papers stored initially in manila folders (one to five leaves per folder, depending on how uneven they were).
After some time being flattened in these folders, the papers were removed, scanned, and uploaded here for description and access.
